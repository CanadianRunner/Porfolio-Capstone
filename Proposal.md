Name of Student: Sean Keane

Name of Project: Portfolio Website

Project's Purpose or Goal: Provide companies/other programmers insight into my body of work.  It will also function as hub for interested parties.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:  
Create a custom webpage that I can use to showcase my work as a developer.
My portfolio will have a custom domain and will be available on presentation day.
It will have links to my past projects/code reviews.
It will have an attractive homepage with custom styling
I will have consistent design language with a custom header/footer present throughout the app.
I need to understand more about hosting and will dive into hosting my website on a Rasberry Pi.
I will start with this resource (I have no previous experience with Rasberry Pi). https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-raspberry-pi

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
I intend to develop this application with React and JS animations.  
I will store my data in MySQL.


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
Adding security measures/certificates to the site.
Add custom animations to the webpages/buttons.
Add scalabilty to user count.
Develop styling to account for mobile devices.
DALLE AI image generation tab
Funny idea add console.logs for other developers.
Firebase implementation
Research and potentially implement https://www.fullstory.com/

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I spent the majority of my first session seeking resources/reading documentation.
